1. socket and connect
2. argv
3. they are all the same
4. the port number changes
5. Just one server socket for all clients
6. They are diaplayed as 0s on the client, but are printed on the server
7. when the local socket isn't set, it defaults to 0.0.0.0:0 and the port is 0 until we send something.
8. 3
9. 3
10. 3
11. because all receive operations return only one packet
12. 3
13. no, only 1 byte per packet was received
14. sfd lasts the entirety of the server while clientfd only lasts as long as the server serves the client.
15. Now, when I call connect, a three way hand shake will be initiated.
16. For different messages in the same socket, the port is the same
17. The local ports are different when sent using another socket
18. One socket for each client whereas with udp, there is one socket for all clients
19. 3
20. 3
21. 1, because instead of reading individual packets, like in udp, the packets
    are buffered and read all at once.
22. 15
23. yes
24. 0ef39a3f241cdd6552ad131e01afa9171b3dab8d
25. 0dd26ed8deacdffb8dc1bb20eec8cf01f027892f
26. c03ce59f9d77e2a3cf001d9dfcb66675ac1a5a81
27. it waits
28. returns smaller value than number requested
29. the remaining data in the packet is discarded
30. recv is called as long as there are more bytes to be read in the buffer
